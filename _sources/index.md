DP0.2 is a Rubin Observatory LSST data preview, based on images from the DC2 data challenge by LSST-DESC (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05926). This was processed using version 23 of the [LSST Science Pipelines](https://pipelines.lsst.io/) on the wide-fast-deep (WFD) field with a baseline cadence. You can find a huge amount of information on the DP0.2 data [here](https://dp0-2.lsst.io/)

For the contexts of these tutorials we're showing how to use the DP0.2 data available on NERSC. This is for the most part catalog-level data stored in flat files, most often in parquet format. If you would like to use the full set of DP0.2 data available, you can do so by becoming a DP0.2 delegate and accessing the data on the RSP. Delegate applications are currently open to all data rights holders, and you can follow the instructions [here](https://dp0.lsst.io/delegate-resources/index.html).
